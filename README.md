Created a number guessing game using the WHILE LOOP where:

A random number between 1 and 100 is generated.
The user is asked to guess the number.
If the user's guess is less than the number, print "The number is greater".
If the user's guess is greater than the number, print "The number is smaller".
If the user's guess is equal to the number, print "Congratulations! You found the number".
If the user runs out of attempts, print "Sorry, you've used all your attempts. The number was: [number]".
Repeat the process 5 times.
